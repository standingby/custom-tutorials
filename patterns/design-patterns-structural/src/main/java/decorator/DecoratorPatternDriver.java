/**
 * A Decorator pattern can be used to attach additional responsibilities to an object either
 * statically or dynamically. A Decorator provides an enhanced interface to the original object.
 *
 * In the implementation of this pattern, we prefer composition over an inheritance â€“ so that we can
 * reduce the overhead of subclassing again and again for each decorating element. The recursion
 * involved with this design can be used to decorate our object as many times as we require.
